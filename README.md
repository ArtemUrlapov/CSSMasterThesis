**Mass Media Coverage of International Conflicts: Differencies by Countries and Ideologies.**

While this piece of research is certainly not the first one that has been undertaken as an attempt to rigorously analyse mass media coverage of international conflicts, there is a reason to believe that a high degree of novelty is brought in.

This is so because the theme in question is addressed following the framework of the emerging field of Computational Social Science, and –for the first time in a study of this kind– the concepts of “psychic distance” and “multipolarity” are introduced.

Furthermore, the present author not only demonstrates the validity of usage of the aforementioned ideas for an exhaustive analysis of international conflicts in post-Cold War era, but the notion of “psychic distance” is further refined by making a distinction between positive and negative psychic distance.

Even though –due to the fact that computational requirements for this body of work are exceedingly high– Russo-Ukrainian War is analysed (for which, a total of 1.440 pieces of data have been extracted for a time interval of 60 days alone), a wide-ranging structure has been put in place.

This includes both an extensive and highly systematic review of a series of historical insights, sociological considerations, computational aspects, time series analysis, sentiment analysis, and / or frequency analysis.

Thus, theoretical and computational insights provided allow for manifold lines of research, that can be applicable not only to mass media coverage of international conflicts, but even to the study of other important events, such as climate change or economic crises (as long as data is available).

Finally, while this body of work constitutes a comprehensive framework on how to proceed with the analysis of mass media coverage of international conflicts, the –hereby– presented structure allows any potential researcher to expand the lines of enquiry in a significant number of different ways.

After all, doing research means nothing if knowledge is not shared with the others.

For this reason and in the spirit of complete academic openness and transparency, R code (which can easily be adopted to other programming languages: for instance, Python) is provided here in full. Additionally, all the required Excel files, in which extracted information has been stored, are equally made available.
